# Napoleon's Battles: A Turn-Based Strategy Game

## 1. Game Overview

This project aims to develop a turn-based strategy game inspired by the battles of Napoleon Bonaparte. Players will command armies, maneuver units, and engage in tactical combat on various historical battlefields.

*   **Genre:** Turn-Based Strategy
*   **Platform:** Desktop (initially console-based, with potential for cross-platform GUI)
*   **Language:** Rust

## 2. Core Mechanics (Initial MVP Scope)

*   **Unit Representation:**
    *   Basic unit types (e.g., Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery).
    *   Units will have fundamental stats (e.g., attack, defense, movement points).
*   **Map Representation:**
    *   A simple grid-based map.
    *   Basic terrain types (e.g., Plains, Forest, Hills) with initial placeholder effects.
*   **Combat System:**
    *   Simplified combat resolution (e.g., deterministic damage based on stats).
*   **Game Flow:**
    *   Turn-based system where players issue commands to their units.
    *   Basic win/loss conditions (e.g., eliminate all enemy units).

## 3. Key Features (Post-MVP)

*   **Advanced Unit Attributes:** Historical accuracy for unit stats and abilities.
*   **Terrain Effects:** Meaningful impact of terrain on movement and combat.
*   **Morale System:** Unit morale affected by combat outcomes and supply.
*   **Commander Units:** Introduction of historical commanders (e.g., Napoleon, Wellington) with unique abilities and command ranges.
*   **Supply System:** Basic supply lines and their impact on unit effectiveness.
*   **AI Opponent:** A simple AI for single-player mode.
*   **Victory Conditions:** Diverse victory conditions, such as capturing key objectives or inflicting a certain level of casualties.

## 4. Development Plan

1.  **Project Setup & Basic Structure (Current Stage):**
    *   Repository initialization and `README.md` creation.
    *   Define basic module structure (e.g., `game_logic`, `map`, `unit`).
2.  **MVP Implementation:**
    *   Implement core unit representation.
    *   Develop a simple grid-based map.
    *   Implement basic unit movement.
    *   Create a fundamental combat logic.
3.  **Iterative Feature Enhancement:**
    *   Implement terrain effects.
    *   Develop the morale system.
    *   Introduce commander units.
    *   Build a basic AI.
4.  **UI/UX Development:**
    *   Enhance console UI or explore GUI libraries (e.g., `egui`, `iced`).
5.  **Testing and Refinement:**
    *   Write unit and integration tests for all major features.
    *   Regularly debug and refine gameplay based on testing and feedback.

## 5. Technical Stack

*   **Language:** Rust
*   **Build System:** Cargo
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
